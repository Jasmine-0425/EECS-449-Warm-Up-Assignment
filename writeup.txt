Part 1.
There were some problem with mongosh setup (port 27017 cannot work for me). 
I switched to port 27018 following Chris' advice on Ed. Other things went well.

Part 2.
I had problem trying to integrate the second LLM, GPT2, into same server.jac file.
So I created another file, gpt_server.jac to run them separately to resolve the issue.
Also, in running client.jac, it automatically interprets my directory name (contains \UM) 
as Unicode (since it contains \U) so I had to change directory name.

Part 3. 
Things went well in this part.

1. Explain what the state represents and how it can be used in the chatbot:
Recommendation handles scenarios where the user wants specific recommendations 
based on predefined criteria, such as suggesting products, services, or actions. 
The chatbot will respond with personalized recommendations based on the query 
and the context.

2. Explain how the chatbot will route the user query to your custom chat model based on the classification:
The routing logic is based on the classification of the userâ€™s query. 
The classify function will analyze the user's message and determine whether 
the query belongs to RAG, QA, or the new Recommendation category. 
If the message fits the recommendation category, the chatbot will route the query 
to the RecommendationChat node. This node will then respond with personalized suggestions
 or recommendations based on previous interactions or context.
